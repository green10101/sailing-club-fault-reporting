# Sailing Club Fault Reporting Application

This project is a web application designed for reporting faults in a sailing club's fleet of hire boats. It allows users to submit fault reports, which can be managed by bosuns. The application includes features for public reporting, bosun management, and email notifications for repair jobs.

## Features

- **Public Reporting**: Users can report faults through a user-friendly form.
- **Bosun Management**: Bosuns can log in to manage reported faults, update statuses, and add notes.
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic email notifications are sent for repair job assignments and completions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sailing-club-fault-reporting
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Composer:
   ```
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a new database and import the `sql/schema.sql` file.
   - Update the database connection settings in `src/config/database.php`.

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values as needed.

5. Run the application:
   - Start a local server or use Docker to run the application.

## Production Deployment

For a production deployment, only deploy the files required to run the application.

### Required at Runtime

- `public/`
- `src/`
- `resources/`
- `.htaccess`
- `.env`
- `vendor/` if dependencies are installed before deployment

If your deployment process runs `composer install` on the server, you can deploy `composer.json` and `composer.lock` instead of uploading `vendor/`.

### Not Required in Production

These files and folders are development, debugging, setup, or documentation artifacts and should normally be excluded from production deployments:

- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`
- `README.md`
- `phpunit.xml`
- `.phpunit.result.cache`
- `tests/`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.vscode/`
- `.git/`
- `composer-setup.php`
- `composer.phar`
- `vendor.zip`
- `vendor.tar.gz`
- `check_columns.php`
- `check_login_counts.php`
- `create_admin.php`
- `create_admin_user.php`
- `debug_user.php`
- `fix_user_password.php`
- `redirect-old-site.htaccess`
- `public/error_log`

### Database Files

The `sql/` and `migrations/` folders are useful for new environments, upgrades, and recovery, but they are not required for normal runtime once the production database has already been created and migrated.

### GitHub and `.deployignore`

GitHub does not natively use a `.deployignore` file. It only understands `.gitignore`.

If you deploy with GitHub Actions, a `.deployignore` file only has an effect if your workflow explicitly reads it and excludes matching files during packaging or upload. Without that workflow logic, `.deployignore` is just a normal file in the repository.

## Usage

- Navigate to the application in your web browser.
- Users can report faults using the public form.
- Bosuns can log in to manage reports and receive notifications via email.
